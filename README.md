# Dynamic Type - Reference App

![](Images/mini_logo.png)

### I have started using Dynamic Type in all my projects, but often I have no idea how will some of the less common styles look with very big font sizes.

So I created **Dynamic Type Reference** which is small app that has all the available styles in table view and you can use Accessibility Inspector on your Mac to adjust font sizes and see the changes in real time.

There is `Edit` button to enter custom text which will then be previewed. Use the refresh button on the right to reset this text.

I also have small app to **preview all available keyboard types**. Check it out [here](https://github.com/nemecek-filip/KeyboardPreview.iOS) :-)

The idea is to have this app deployed on your in use simulators and then quickly check text you want to use in your own app here before choosing style. 

*Feel free to point out improvements or just open PR :-)*
